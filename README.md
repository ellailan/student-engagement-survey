# UBC's AMS' Student Engagement Survey 2025
This repo holds my data analysis for UBC's Alma Mater Society's 2025 Student Engagement Survey. Administered to 5000 students on campus, this repo runs on a .csv file as it is directly exported from Qualtrics.

This repo contains:
- sesquestions.md, the list of questions administered
  
- datacleaning.R, used to clean data, name variables, etc.
  
- summarystats.R, used to generate summary statistics
  
- summarygraphs.R, used to generate graphs to accompany summary statistics

- likert-mwtest.R, used to generate likert-scale graphs and analyze distributions using a Mann-Whitney U test
